# dateFunctions
This is a first draft and hopes to deal with certain date functions. Since starting this I have developed a few new ways of dealing with these scenarios one of which includes building a calendar table that holds a list of dates and the date properties.


This inclludes a function for returning an array of UK Bank Holidays for any yeay though this does not yet include non standard bank holidays or those adjusted as a result of non standard bank holidays. 

Examples of a non standard bank holiday is where there are bank holidays for royal weddings. Sometimes such bank holidays fall too close to standard holidays and as such the standard holiday is moved. Non standard holidays are coming soon.
